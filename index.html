<h3>About</h3>

<p>I am a Graduate student at <a href = "https://www.berkeley.edu/">The University of California, Berkeley</a> pursuing a Master of Information and Management Science <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims">(MIMS)</a> with a concentration in natural language processing. I'm centrally interested in the effect of technology on how we use and understand language.</p>

<p>I am returning to school after working as a Back-End Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.brightspot.com/">Brightspot</a> for 2 years. I architected the data pipelines and content solutions for clients like <a href="https://www.mattressfirm.com">Mattress Firm</a>. I gained robust experience migrating data, working with REST APIs and collaborating with client stakeholders using Java and MySQL.</p>

<p>In undergrad, I studied Computer Science and English at <a href = "https://www.virginia.edu/">The University of Virginia</a> and graduated with High Honors. My thesis project, <a href = "/thesis"><i>A Digital Analysis of the Lyrical Novel</i></a>, was advised by <a href="https://english.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/bmp7e">Brad Pasanek</a>. Other involvements at UVA include earning a Research Assistant position at UVA's Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (<a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/">IATH</a>) and membership with Brad's wonderful <a href="https://puzzlepoesis.org">Puzzle Poetry</a> group.</p>

<p>The <a href="/projects">Projects</a> section contains personal areas of interest like <a href = "/projects/wapo">data automation</a> and <a href = "/projects/sbotus">language modeling</a> with Python and R. Check out the <a href="/blog">Blog</a> for informal updates and experiments.</p>

<p><b>I'm on the job market!</b> I am interested in ML and NLP engineering summer internship roles. Please reach out if you think I'd be a good fit via <a href="mailto:timschott@berkeley.edu">email</a> or <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/timothy-schott">LinkedIn</a>!</p>
