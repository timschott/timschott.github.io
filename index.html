<h2> About me </h2>

<p>I am a Graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley School of Information. I'm focusing on Natural Language Processing. I'm centrally interested in the effect of technology on how we use and understand language. The results of merging digital advances with written and spoken language deserve careful evaluation.</p>

<p>I returned to school after working as a Back-End Engineer at <a href="https://www.brightspot.com/">Brightspot</a> for two years. I architected the data pipelines and content solutions for clients such as Boston Consulting Group and Mattress Firm. I worked with Java, MySQL, Docker and Tomcat and gained robust experience integrating with REST APIs as well as explaining complex technical outcomes to broad audiences.</p>

<p>Prior to that, I the University of Virginia, where I received Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and English.</p>

<p>Jump to the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> vertical to look at the ambitious endeavors I've worked on since I graduated from UVA. Most of the code featured in those projects is written in R and Python. Also, feel free to peruse the <a href="/blog">Blog</a>, which contains fairly informal updates and experiments. Of late, I'm developing a series of entries about Don DeLillo that will culminate in a digital reevaluation of his work.</p>

<p>I'm happy to talk programming, books or anything in between. The code for this site is <a href="https://github.com/timschott/timschott.github.io">here</a>. Please reach out via <a href="mailto:timcschott@gmail.com">email!</a></p>
