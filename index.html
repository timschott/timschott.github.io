<h2> About me </h2>

<p> I am a recent graduate of the University of Virginia, where I studied English and Computer Science. I have worked as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.brightspot.com/">Brightspot</a> for just over a year.</p>

<p>The work featured on this website focuses primarily on applying digital modes of analysis to literature. An area I keep coming back to is the effect of technology on how we use and understand language. My posts and projects reflect my best efforts to complicate and understand this phenomenon.</p>

<p>The <a href="/blog">Blog</a> on this website is fairly informal; jump over to the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> vertical to take a look at the more ambitious endeavors I've worked on over the past year. At work I use Java and MySQL, but most of the code featured in those projects is written in R or Python. </p>

<p>I'm happy to talk programming, literature or anything in between. The code for this site is <a href="https://github.com/timschott/timschott.github.io">here</a> Please reach out via email or find me on Twitter!</p>
