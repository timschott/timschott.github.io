<p>Hello there! I'm a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.redventures.com">Red Ventures</a>. My passion lies in harnessing the power of machine learning to tackle problems that involve large amounts of data &mdash; especially <i>textual</i> data from sources like news stories and cultural artifacts.</p>

<p>I recently received my Master's from The University of California, Berkeley studying <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims">Information Management and Systems</a> with an emphasis on Data Science and NLP. My thesis <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2022/calibragpt-identifying-misinformation-large-language-models">project </a> addressed multilingual factual associations in large language models. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13675">preprint</a> (which will hopefully be conference official soon!) discusses our results and potential remedies to the gaps in understanding we uncovered. I also held a Teaching Assistant position for Berkeley's <a href="https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~dbamman/nlp23.html">Natural Language Processing</a> courses</p>.

<p>In the summer of 2022, I worked as a Graduate Data Science Intern with <a href = "https://redventures.com">Red Ventures</a>. I explored and improved RV's <a href="https://medium.com/rv-data/how-to-build-a-better-bandit-3cbc278429c6">decision optimization API</a>. I dove deep into fascinating areas like reinforcement learning and applied statistics while working with massive amounts of real-world data.</p>

<p>Prior to grad school, I worked as a Back End Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.brightspot.com/">Brightspot</a> for 2 years. During my time there, I designed and implemented data pipelines and content solutions for high-profile clients like <a href="https://www.mattressfirm.com">Mattress Firm</a> and <a href="https://janes.com">Janes</a>. This role gave me invaluable experience in data modeling, API construction, and stakeholder collaboration, which I've carried forward into my current work.</p>

<p>In undergrad, I double-majored in <a href = "https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/about-computer-science/about-us">Computer Science</a> and <a href ="https://english.as.virginia.edu/undergraduate">English</a> at The University of Virginia, graduating with High Honors in 2019. My thesis project for the English department, <a href = "/thesis"><i>A Digital Analysis of the Lyrical Novel</i></a>, was advised by <a href="https://english.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/bmp7e">Brad Pasanek</a>. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to earn a Research Assistant position at <a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/">The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities and assist with Brad's <a href="https://bpasanek.github.io/puzzlepoesis/about.html">Puzzle Poetry</a> project, which were wonderful chances to explore of digital humanities methodologies.</p>
