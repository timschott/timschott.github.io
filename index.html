<h2> About me </h2>

<p> I am a recent graduate of the University of Virginia, where I received Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and English. I have worked full-time as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.brightspot.com/">Brightspot</a> for a year and a half, focusing on back-end web development.</p>

<p>The work featured on this website focuses primarily on applying digital modes of analysis to literature. This is the area of the natural language processing field that intrigues me the most. Of particular interest is the effect of technology on how we use and understand language; my posts and projects reflect my best efforts to complicate and understand this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Jump to the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> vertical to look at the ambitious endeavors I've worked on since I graduated. Professionally I use Java and MySQL, but most of the code featured in those projects is written in R or Python. Also, feel free to peruse the <a href="/blog">Blog</a>, which contains fairly informal updates and experiments. Of late, I'm developing a series of entries about Don DeLillo that will culminate in a digital reevaluation of his work.</p>

<p>I'm happy to talk programming, books or anything in between. The code for this site is <a href="https://github.com/timschott/timschott.github.io">here</a>. Please reach out via <a href="mailto:timcschott@gmail.com">email!</a></p>
