<h2> About me </h2>

<p> I am a recent graduate of the University of Virginia, where I studied English and Computer Science. I am currently a Software Engineer at Brightspot.</p>

<p>This blog originally started as a place to document my progress for my undergraduate honors thesis at the University of Virginia. Since graduation, I've done my best to pursue endeavors outside of my full time job so I'm expanding the scope of this site to document other explorations.</p>

<p>I focus on applying digital modes of analysis to literature. A question I keep coming back to is the effect of technology on how we use and understand language; the posts and projects featured on this site reflect my best efforts to complicate and understand this phenomenon.</p>

<p>At my day job I use Java, but most of the work featured here is based in R or Python. I have a fairly broad development background, spanning from the newer deep learning frameworks to other areas like data warehousing and working with REST APIs. I'm happy to talk programming, literature or anything in between. Please reach out via email or find me on Twitter!</p>
