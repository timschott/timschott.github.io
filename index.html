I am a Senior Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.redventures.com">Red Ventures</a>, where I work on the Red Platform team building machine learning systems used across the organization. My work supports customer segmentation, funnel optimization, and large-scale decisioning, including contributions to a multi-armed bandit–based <a href="https://medium.com/rv-data/how-to-build-a-better-bandit-3cbc278429c6">decision API</a>.

<p>
I received a Master’s degree in Information Management and Systems from <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu">the University of California, Berkeley</a>, with a focus on data science and natural language processing. My thesis examined multilingual factual knowledge recall in large language models; this work was published at <a href="https://2023.emnlp.org/">EMNLP 2023</a>. While at Berkeley, I served as a teaching assistant for Professor David Bamman’s <a href="https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~dbamman/nlp23.html">natural language processing</a> courses.

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a backend software engineer at <a href="https://www.brightspot.com/">Brightspot</a>, where I designed data pipelines and content platforms for enterprise clients including <a href="https://www.mattressfirm.com">Mattress Firm</a> and <a href="https://janes.com">Janes</a>. This role emphasized data modeling, API design, and cross-functional collaboration.

I earned a BA in Computer Science and a BA in English from <a href="https://www.virginia.edu">the University of Virginia</a>, graduating with High Honors in 2019. My <a href="/thesis">Distinguished Majors thesis</a> was completed under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://english.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/bmp7e">Brad Pasanek</a>, and I previously served as a research assistant at <a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/">the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities</a>.
