<p>I'm a Master's student at The University of California, Berkeley studying <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims">Information Management and Systems (MIMS)</a> with a concentration in Data Science. I'm passionate about applying machine learning methods to solve problems involving large amounts of data. I am currently a Teaching Assistant for Berkeley's Information Organization and Retrieval <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/202">course</a> taught by <a href="https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~dbamman/">David Bamman.</a></p>

<p>Prior to grad school, I worked as a Back-End Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.brightspot.com/">Brightspot</a> for 2 years. I architected the data pipelines and content solutions for clients like <a href="https://www.mattressfirm.com">Mattress Firm</a> and <a href="https://janes.com">Janes</a>. I gained robust experience modeling data, constructing APIs, and collaborating with client stakeholders.</p>

<p>In undergrad, I double-majored in <a href = "https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/about-computer-science/about-us">Computer Science</a> and <a href ="https://english.as.virginia.edu/undergraduate">English</a> at The University of Virginia and graduated with High Honors. My thesis project for the English department, <a href = "/thesis"><i>A Digital Analysis of the Lyrical Novel</i></a>, was advised by <a href="https://english.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/bmp7e">Brad Pasanek</a>. Other involvements at UVA include earning a Research Assistant position at The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (<a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/">IATH</a>) and assisting with Brad's <a href="https://puzzlepoesis.org">Puzzle Poetry</a> project.</p>

<p>I'm currently researching the role of description in fiction. The goal of my <a href = "https://github.com/timschott/details">research</a> is to to disambiguate critical attitudes towards fictional description using methods from fields like cultural analytics and machine learning. After <a href="https://github.com/timschott/details/blob/main/paper/details-in-the-novel.pdf">starting</a> the project in Fall 2021 during Professor Bamman's Applied Natural Language Processing course, I presented my <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timschott/details/main/dh-fair/tim-schott-dh-fair-poster.png">progress</a> at the 2022 Berkeley Digital Humanities Fair. I'm currently continuing this research via an independent study supervised by Professor Bamman.</p> 

<p>This summer, I worked as a Graduate Data Science Intern with <a href = "https://redventures.com">Red Ventures</a>. As a member of Red Platform, RV's central DS team, I explored and improved RV's<a href="https://medium.com/rv-data/how-to-build-a-better-bandit-3cbc278429c6">decision optimization API</a>, which provided a wonderful exposure to areas in reinforcement learning and applied statistics. This exposed me to fascinating areas like reinforcement learning and gave me a chance to work with massive amounts of data in a fast-paced, real-world setting. I'm looking forward to returning to the team full-time after graduation!</p>
