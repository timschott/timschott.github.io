<h3>About</h3>

<p>I am a Graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley pursuing a Master of Information and Management Science <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims">(MIMS)</a>. I'm focusing on Natural Language Processing. I'm centrally interested in the effect of technology on how we use and understand language.</p>

<p>I am returning to school after working as a Back-End Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.brightspot.com/">Brightspot</a> for 2 years. Highlights include architecting the data pipelines and content solutions for clients <a href="https://www.mattressfirm.com">Mattress Firm</a>. I worked with Java and gained robust experience integrating with REST APIs, modeling data and presenting to client stakeholders.</p>

<p>In undergrad, I studied Computer Science and English at the University of Virginia and graduated with High Honors. My thesis project, <i>A Digital Analysis of the Lyrical Novel</i>, was advised by <a href="https://english.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/bmp7e">Brad Pasanek</a>. Other involvements at UVA include earning a Research Assistant position at UVA's Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (<a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/">IATH</a>) and productive contributions to Brad's wonderful <a href="https://puzzlepoesis.org">Puzzle Poetry</a> group</p>.

<p>The <a href="/projects">Projects</a> section contains personal projects of interest mostly written in Python and R. Also, feel free to check out the <a href="/blog">Blog</a>, which contains fairly informal updates and experiments.</p>
