<p>Hello there! I'm a Master's student at The University of California, Berkeley studying <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims">Information Management and Systems</a> with an emphasis on Data Science and NLP. My passion lies in harnessing the power of machine learning to tackle problems that involve large amounts of data &mdash; especially <i>textual</i> data from sources like books!</p>
    
<p>At Berkeley, I'm a Teaching Assistant for <a href="https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~dbamman/nlp23.html">Natural Language Processing</a> taught by <a href="https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~dbamman/">David Bamman.</a> I'm also immersed in a fascinating research project addressing misinformation in pretrained language models. The goal of this <a href="https://github.com/daniel-furman/capstone">research</a> is to 1) benchmark the amount of incorrect information widely used models contain and 2) provide a methodology for repairing false factual associations to guarantee more accurate and effective usage of these models down the road. I'm working with fellow classmates as part of our MIMS <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2022/calibragpt-identifying-misinformation-large-language-models">capstone project</a> under the advisement of Professor Bamman. 

<p>Recently, I worked as a Graduate Data Science Intern with <a href = "https://redventures.com">Red Ventures</a>. I explored and improved RV's <a href="https://medium.com/rv-data/how-to-build-a-better-bandit-3cbc278429c6">decision optimization API</a>. I dove deep into fascinating areas like reinforcement learning and applied statistics while working with massive amounts of real-world data. I'm thrilled to be joining the team full-time after I graduate and can't wait to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible with data science!</p>

<p>Prior to grad school, I worked as a Back End Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.brightspot.com/">Brightspot</a> for 2 years. During my time there, I designed and implemented data pipelines and content solutions for high-profile clients like <a href="https://www.mattressfirm.com">Mattress Firm</a> and <a href="https://janes.com">Janes</a>. This role gave me invaluable experience in data modeling, API construction, and stakeholder collaboration, which I've carried forward into my current work.</p>

<p>In undergrad, I double-majored in <a href = "https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/about-computer-science/about-us">Computer Science</a> and <a href ="https://english.as.virginia.edu/undergraduate">English</a> at The University of Virginia, graduating with High Honors in 2019. My thesis project for the English department, <a href = "/thesis"><i>A Digital Analysis of the Lyrical Novel</i></a>, was advised by <a href="https://english.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/bmp7e">Brad Pasanek</a>. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to earn a Research Assistant position at <a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/">The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities and assist with Brad's <a href="https://bpasanek.github.io/puzzlepoesis/about.html">Puzzle Poetry</a> project, which were wonderful chances to explore of digital humanities methodologies.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to learn more about me and my work. If you're interested in collaborating or learning more, please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
