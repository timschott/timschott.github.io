<h3>About</h3>

<p>I'm a Master's student at UC Berkeley studying <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims">Information Management and Systems (MIMS)</a> with a concentration in Data Science. I'm passionate about applying machine learning methods to solve problems involving large amounts of textual data.</p>

<p>I returned to school after working as a Back-End Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.brightspot.com/">Brightspot</a> for 2 years. I architected the data pipelines and content solutions for clients like <a href="https://www.mattressfirm.com">Mattress Firm</a> and <a href="https://janes.com">Janes</a>. I gained robust experience modeling data, integrating and writing APIs, and collaborating across different teams with client stakeholders.</p>

<p>In undergrad, I double-majored in <a href = "https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/about-computer-science/about-us">Computer Science</a> and <a href ="https://english.as.virginia.edu/undergraduate">English</a> at The University of Virginia and graduated with High Honors. My thesis project, <a href = "/thesis"><i>A Digital Analysis of the Lyrical Novel</i></a>, was advised by <a href="https://english.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/bmp7e">Brad Pasanek</a>. Other involvements at UVA include earning a Research Assistant position at The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (<a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/">IATH</a>) and assisting with Brad's <a href="https://puzzlepoesis.org">Puzzle Poetry</a> project.</p>

<p>Academic projects like my <a href = "/projects/details">ongoing, quantitative analysis</a> of details in the novel, plus other personal projects like a <a href = "/projects/sbotus">language model trained on Supreme Court data</a>, can be found in the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> section. Check out the <a href="/blog">Blog</a> for informal updates and experiments.</p>

<p><b>I'm on the job market!</b> I'm interested in Data Science and NLP summer internship roles. Please reach out if you think I'd be a good fit via <a href="mailto:timschott@berkeley.edu">email</a> or <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/timothy-schott">LinkedIn</a>!</p>
