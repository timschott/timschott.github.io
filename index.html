<p>I'm a Master's student at UC Berkeley studying <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims">Information Management and Systems (MIMS)</a> with a concentration in Data Science. I'm passionate about applying machine learning methods to solve problems involving large amounts of textual data. I am currently a Teaching Assistant for Berkeley's Information Organization and Retrieval <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/202">course</a> taught by <a href="https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~dbamman/">David Bamman.</a></p>

<p>Prior to grad school, I worked as a Back-End Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.brightspot.com/">Brightspot</a> for 2 years. I architected the data pipelines and content solutions for clients like <a href="https://www.mattressfirm.com">Mattress Firm</a> and <a href="https://janes.com">Janes</a>. I gained robust experience modeling data, integrating and writing APIs, and collaborating across different teams with client stakeholders.</p>

<p>In undergrad, I double-majored in <a href = "https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/about-computer-science/about-us">Computer Science</a> and <a href ="https://english.as.virginia.edu/undergraduate">English</a> at The University of Virginia and graduated with High Honors. My thesis project, <a href = "/thesis"><i>A Digital Analysis of the Lyrical Novel</i></a>, was advised by <a href="https://english.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/bmp7e">Brad Pasanek</a>. Other involvements at UVA include earning a Research Assistant position at The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (<a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/">IATH</a>) and assisting with Brad's <a href="https://puzzlepoesis.org">Puzzle Poetry</a> project.</p>

<p>Academic projects like my <a href = "/projects/details">ongoing, quantitative analysis</a> of details in the novel (via an independent study advised by Professor Bamman), plus other personal projects like a <a href = "/projects/sbotus">language model trained on Supreme Court data</a>, can be found in the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> section. Check out the <a href="/blog">Blog</a> for informal updates and experiments.</p>

<p>This summer, I worked as a Graduate Data Science Intern with <a href = "https://redventures.com">Red Ventures</a>. As a member of the central platform team, I worked on improving RV's bandit learning pipeline. This exposed me to fascinating areas of development like reinforcement learning and gave me a chance to work with massive amounts of data in a fast-paced, real-world setting.</p>
