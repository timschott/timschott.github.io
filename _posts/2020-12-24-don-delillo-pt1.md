## When It Started

I first heard of Don DeLillo in an Introduction to Literary Criticism course taught by the imitable [Rita Felski](https://english.as.virginia.edu/felski). Professor Felski stated that *White Noise*, DeLillo's breakout novel published in 1985, remains one of her favorite novels. I took everything Professor Felski recommended to heart; her insight into literature and art more broadly is staggering. In fact, the conceit of my thesis -- focusing on one word, "lyrical" -- was heavily influenced by her collection of phenomenological essays, [Uses of Literature](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Uses+of+Literature-p-9781405147231), in which Felski bridges the gap between the every day experience of reading and the critical planks that inhere books and our responses to them.

Now, that was 2018. Here I was, in the Spring of 2020, sorting out my roadmap for what the next nine or so months of my life would entail.
