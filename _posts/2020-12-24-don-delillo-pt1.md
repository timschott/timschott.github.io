## What's Here, and What's Coming

Don Dellilo is the most underrated novelist of the 20th century. I don't care if he's received the National Book Award, or the PEN/Faulkner medal, or whatever other honorifics the academy has applied to him. 

## When It Started

I first heard of Don DeLillo in an Introduction to Literary Criticism course taught by the imitable [Rita Felski](https://english.as.virginia.edu/felski). Professor Felski stated that *White Noise*, DeLillo's breakout novel published in 1985, remains one of her favorite novels. I took everything Professor Felski recommended to heart; her insight into literature and art more broadly is staggering. In fact, the conceit of my thesis -- focusing on one word, "lyrical" -- was heavily influenced by her collection of phenomenological essays, [Uses of Literature](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Uses+of+Literature-p-9781405147231), in which Felski bridges the gap between the every day experience of reading and the critical planks that inhere books and our responses to them.

Now, that was 2018. Here I was, in the Spring of 2020, sorting out my roadmap for what the next nine or so months of my life would entail ... until, of course, everything turned on it's head with the global pandemic. Now, I had always intended to return to graduate school after a year or two of working, but the early days of "lockdown" made it difficult to think that any plans I created in, say, April would even be possible come June, September, etc. 

The world felt scary. There was a palpable anxiety whenever I checked in with colleagues or friends from college (via Zoom, of course). The news was increasingly negative, and I was extremely worried about my parents, with whom I lived up until this June.

## Throwing The Book At It

So where exactly does DeLillo fit into this constellation? He's never written a book, explicitly, about a pandemic, mega-virus, etc. That's territory typically reserved for stalwart sci-fi writers, or their progenitors, like Mary Shelley's [The Last Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Man) or Stephen King's [The Stand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stand).

*White Noise*, though, with it's ruminations on death and a rapidly shifting society aligns with many of the aspects of current historical moment. Much like the gold standard for post-modernism, *Pale Fire*, whose shadow looms over DeLillo's ouevre, *White Noise* sweeps us away to a quaint college town. The book follows Jack Gladney, a professor at the forefront of the "Hitler studies" field. Jack (along with his wife, Babette) obsesses with death. Now on the one hand, a constant grappling with mortality is to be expected from a professor of "Hitler studies." However, the town's exposure to a hazardous chemical agent in what DeLillo calls "The Airborne Toxic Event" engenders a frenzy for all parties involved. 

Babette embroils herself in a tryst with a pharmaceutical salesman who pushes her to try "Dylar," a pill purporting to assuage death-terror. Jack, meanwhile, faces exposure to the chemical, and his mental state similarly deteriorates. Towards the work's close, he remarks to a colleague, "I'm just going through the motions of living. I'm technically dead." And in an aleatory society built upon exploitation and swindle, who isn't?

Overall, reading *White Noise* left me disoriented. It's a challenging read, certainly, both in form and subject matter. At multiple points, I felt as if I had been teleported back to my "Freud and Literature" course, learning about the concept of the "death drive". DeLillo is eminently perspicacious. Almost to a fault. But he imbues a remarkable liquidity into his paragraphs. The descriptions of the vagaries of everyday life the shopping cart, the syndicated television program, the college curriculum -- drop the reader into an environment rife with stagnation, futility and charmlessness. A melancholy undergirds the entire work; life lacks coherence or direction. 

*White Noise*, then, is not why I'm enamored with DeLillo's ideas, characters and prose. I moved onto other books (for example all of April and May, it was my GRE math prep book). It wouldn't be until later in the year I fully immersed myself in DeLillo's writing

Now, Thomas Pynchon is often brought up in any conversation about DeLillo. Even a cursory survey of the landscape -- such as examining syllabi, secondary criticism, etc.
