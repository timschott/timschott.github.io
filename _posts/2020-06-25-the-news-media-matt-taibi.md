"On the other side of the political aisle, among self-described liberals, we’re watching an intellectual revolution. It feels liberating to say after years of tiptoeing around the fact, but the American left has lost its mind. It’s become a cowardly mob of upper-class social media addicts, Twitter Robespierres who move from discipline to discipline torching reputations and jobs with breathtaking casualness."

definitely a casualness to everything online…. it’s so everyday, but can have real consequences

cites Lee Fang as an example (who ran with an interview of a black man wondering why black on black crime is not more scandalous). 

"It’s stunning that so many colleagues are comfortable using a word as extreme and villainous as racist to describe him.” — i think we underestimate how casual we’ve made words like racist and fascist now…. they carry tons of weight in society at large but we use them so often they have sort of lost meaning. what is a racist? is trump a fascist like bolsonaro or just an idiot in a different way?

"The “bitter” tweet offended staffers at Variety, which is owned by Penske Media Corp., controlled by auto scion Jay Penske — who called Eller’s comment “plainly unacceptable.”
“She should have been listening vs. putting up a fight, and allowing for others to be heard and to heal,” Penske said, adding in a note to the staff that business editor Cynthia Littleton would assume Eller’s role on an interim basis, according to the newspaper."

what is it with this listening language??

The instinct to shield audiences from views or facts deemed politically uncomfortable has been in evidence since Trump became a national phenomenon. 

The Times first attempted to rectify the situation by apologizing, adding a long Editor’s note to Cotton’s piece that read, as so many recent “apologies” have, like a note written by a hostage.

In a note to the Opinion staff Sunday, Ms. Kingsbury, who declined to comment for this article, said that until a more “technical solution” is in place, anyone who sees “any piece of Opinion journalism — including headlines or social posts or photos or you name it — that gives you the slightest pause, please call or text me immediately.” lolllll

Overall, makes a persuasive argument that the state of journalism is very precarious because you have to toe a very specific line. Wake me up when the NYT publishes an Op ed about dismantling capitalism.
