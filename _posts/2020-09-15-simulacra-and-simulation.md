description: Discussing Jean Baudrillard's landmark treatise on semiotics and information theory.

### Overview

Simulcra and Simulation is a provocative examination of the state of reality (or lack thereof) with respect to the modern political economy and media atmosphere. It’s a heady, challenging treatise that integrates examples from popular culture (film, novels, current events) into a sweeping investigation of semiotics, cybernetics, and information theory. Three aspects of the work stood out from my reading. I’ll touch on some key terms and then move towards my thoughts on Baudrillard's tenets. 

#### "Simulacram"

To start, let’s define that key term, “simulacram," We can understand the “simulacram” as the mangled hyper-representation of what was once once an identifiable facet of reality. We move, in succession, from:
reality in a defined setting, to
an unfaithful copy of this reality, to
an imitation of reality that masks the essence and makeup of that reality, to, finally
a pure simulation that’s entirely detached from all aspects of reality. 

Baudrillard points to a fable from Borges, wherein cartographers produced a map of an Empire with such exactitude and attention to detail that they managed to (virtually) terraform the mass they were aimed to delineate, as a rendering of simulation. 

#### "Hyperreality"

From there, Baudrillard situates Borges’ tale in our current epoch. This paragraph is worth studying closely as we wrap our heads around the “hyperreal,” the other important concept coined in this work: 

Today abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is nevertheless the map that precedes the territory - precession of simulacra - that engenders the territory, and if one must return to the fable, today it is the territory whose shreds slowly rot across the extent of the map. It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges persist here and there in the deserts that are no longer those of the Empire, but ours. The desert of the real itself.

This phenomenon deludes us into subscribing to a set of facts and assumptions that doesn’t have a bearing on any real objects. We're witness to a landscape that produce itself with no original reference point — no “origin or reality.” We are bereft of representation and reality; in their stead, an alterior construction.
