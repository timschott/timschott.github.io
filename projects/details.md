My semester project for David Bamman's Fall 2021 Applied Natural Language Processing ([INFO 256](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~dbamman/info256.html)) course explores details in narrative fiction. I expanded this work during an independent study supervised by David in Fall 2022.

I was invited to present my work at the <a href ="https://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/dh-fair-2022">2022 UC Berkeley Digital Humanities fair</a>. Here is my poster!
