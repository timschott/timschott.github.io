My honors thesis for the University of Virginia Distinguished Majors program.

My challenge was to source a group of lyrical novels based on publications, recommendations from professors, book jackets. critical surveys….
this is to say that i was very much pleased when i searched lyrical novel into jstory and dozens of results popped up!

I used detective fiction as a control corpus. detective work was inspired by Moretti’s corpus experiments in Canon/Archive - genre fiction is rhetorically stable so it works as a good contrast to the indefinite posture assumed by lyrical works.. 

After processing my texts I created a feature set of 31 potential markers of “lyrical” novels.

My idea was to work with the large feature set and use a combination of supervised learning and close-reading to determine the most consequential.
