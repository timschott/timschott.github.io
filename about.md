This blog originally started as a place to document my progress for my undergraduate honors thesis at the University of Virginia. Since graduation, I've done my best to pursue endeavors outside of my full time job as a Software Engineer at Brightspot, so I'm expanding the scope of this site to document other explorations. 

I focus on combining digital modes of analysis with literature. Forgive the cliche, but I find myself fascinated with how technology intersects with culture. A question I keep coming back to is the effect of technology on how we use and understand language; the projects featured on this site reflect my best efforts to complicate and understand this phenomenon. 

At my day job I use Java, but most of my digital forays are based in R or Python. And I'm fairly well-versed in the newer deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow. I'm happy to talk programming, literature or anything in between. Please reach out via email or find me on Twitter!
